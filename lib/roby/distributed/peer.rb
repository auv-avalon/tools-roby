    # A Peer object is the client part of a connection with a remote plan

    # accessible through the Peer#local_server attribute.
    #
    # == Connection procedure
    #
    # Connections are initiated When the user calls Peer.initiate_connection.
    # The following protocol is then followed:
    # [local] 
    #   if the neighbour is already connected to us, we do nothing and yield
    #   the already existing peer. End.
    # [local]
    #   check if we are already connecting to the peer. If it is the case,
    #   wait for the end of the connection thread.
    # [local] 
    #   otherwise, open a new socket and send the connect() message in it
    #   The connection thread is registered in ConnectionSpace.pending_connections
    # [remote] 
    #   check if we are already connecting to the peer (check ConnectionSpace.pending_connections)
    #   * if it is the case, the lowest token wins
    #   * if 'remote' wins, return :already_connecting
    #   * if 'local' wins, return :connected with the relevant information
    #
    # == Communication
    #
    # Communication is done in two threads. The sending thread gets the calls
    # from Peer#send_queue, formats them and sends them to the PeerServer#demux
    # for processing. The reception thread is managed by dRb and its entry
    # point is always #demux.
    #
    # Very often we need to have processing on both sides to finish an
    # operation. For instance, the creation of two siblings need to register
    # the siblings on both sides. To manage that, it is possible for PeerServer
    # methods which are serving a remote request to queue callbacks.  These
    # callbacks will be processed by Peer#send_thread before the rest of the
